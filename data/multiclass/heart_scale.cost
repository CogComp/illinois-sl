# format: gold prediction cost
# Assume the gold lab is i and prediction is j.
# The cost means that if I mispredict j while the gold lab is i, how much cost should I pay
# 1) when gold and prediction are the same: the cost needs to be zero
# 2) A cost value needs to be positive
-1 +1 1
# hope to bias toward to positive lab
+1 -1 3
