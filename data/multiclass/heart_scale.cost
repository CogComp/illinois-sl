# format: gold_label predicted_label cost
# Assume the gold lab is i and prediction is j.
# The cost specifies the loss when predicting the label of an instance to be j, while the gold label is i.
# 1) when gold and prediction are the same: the cost needs to be zero
# 2) A cost value needs to be positive
-1 +1 1
# hope to bias toward to positive label
+1 -1 3
