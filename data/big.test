The	proposal	is	just	part	of	legislation	that	would	require	businesses	to	provide	health	benefits	,	an	idea	that	is	strongly	opposed	by	small	business	who	say	it	would	just	compound	the	insurance-cost	problems	.

But	small-business	lobbyists	say	they	support	the	idea	,	included	in	the	Kennedy-Waxman	bill	,	of	new	laws	or	regulations	requiring	greater	use	of	community	rating	,	which	pegs	rates	to	the	use	of	health	care	by	a	community	or	other	large	group	,	and	is	designed	to	prevent	insurance	companies	from	taking	only	low-risk	small	companies	as	clients	.
